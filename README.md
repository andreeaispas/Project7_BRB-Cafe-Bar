### üçπüìù I created this website for a recently opened business of some family friends, to help promote and make this Bar visible in our county. 

### üëç In this way, we can offer customers a pleasant and informative online experience about the location. 

## Introduction

This is a code repository for the corresponding Modern UI/UX Website of BRB Cafe&Bar. Through rigorous work on this one I realized how good it is to fix the information you already know and how you can learn new commands in an enjoyable way by following my own design.

What I learned, deepened and developed:

- Figma: I created the website design https://www.figma.com/file/lDxl5R3oC72qtL0hni6KM1/BRB-Cafe%26Bar?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=o9M8PukGmKrZGZzb-1
- Node.js and npm: for setting up the development environment;
- React Functional components and their reusability;
- React file and folder structure;
- Fundamental CSS properties to master flex & grid;
- Fundamentals of the CSS BEM Model;
- From soft and pleasant animations to complex gradients;
- Strategically placed media queries for satisfactory responsiveness covering almost devices.

Site structure:

- a Navbar containing the logo, links to Home, About, Menu, Contact, Social networks (but they still have to edit them);
- at Home we see a representative video with the bartender, with fine details that show quality and a message that tells them that all the locals come here and this aspect makes the atmosphere pleasant;
- follows the section of About and Atmosphere & Concept with a slider of pictures from the Bar;
- the next page shows the Menu, quite diversified and with details of price, quantity, ingredients used in shots;
- I added another video with a group of friends that shows the friendly atmosphere and the rustic setting;
- then follows the Find Us area, with location details and Opening Hours + real maps of the Bar;
- finally, I put the contact details, currently fictitious, and other important information.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
